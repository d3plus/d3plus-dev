# d3plus-dev

A collection of scripts for developing D3plus modules.

## Installing

If using npm, `npm install d3plus-dev`. Otherwise, you can download the [latest release from GitHub](https://github.com/d3plus/d3plus-dev/releases/latest) or load from a [CDN](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3plus-dev@1).

```js
import modules from "d3plus-dev";
```

d3plus-dev can be loaded as a standalone library or bundled as part of [D3plus](https://github.com/d3plus/d3plus). ES modules, AMD, CommonJS, and vanilla environments are supported. In vanilla, a `d3plus` global is exported:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3plus-dev@1"></script>
<script>
  console.log(d3plus);
</script>
```

## Examples

Live examples can be found on [d3plus.org](https://d3plus.org/), which includes a collection of example visualizations using [d3plus-react](https://github.com/d3plus/d3plus-react/). These examples are powered by the [d3plus-storybook](https://github.com/d3plus/d3plus-storybook/) repo, and PRs are always welcome. :beers:
